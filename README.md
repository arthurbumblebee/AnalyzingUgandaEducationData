# AnalyzingUgandaEducationData

CS251 Final Project Arthur

Abstract:
After months of building and developing data analysis and visualization programs, it is only right for me to finally analyze my own dataset(s) extensively, while exploring and attempting to answer questions that intrigue me about the data. This is the essence of this project: the final project. In this project, I am going to dig deep into five data sets regarding the education system in Uganda. I chose to analyze education statistics because I feel that the level of education an individual attains plays a vital role in their standard of living, determining various aspects of the individual's life for example: the kind of jobs they will get, the circle of friends they will have, society's perception of them, to mention but a few. Therefore, discovering various trends in education data becomes a vital tool to better the standards of living of Uganda's population in the long run, because these trends will help inform Uganda's government on where improvements could be made in Uganda's education system.
The education journey in Uganda is divided into various segments and there are national exams to highlight transitions from one stage to the next. For my analysis, I will look at: the Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE), that take you from middle school to high school; the Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) exams, for high school to advanced high school; and Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE) that see a student off to college. I intend to discover if these results from these exams are related at all, and if so, how they affect each other. I also intend to incorporate external factors like marital and child bearing status among female children, in addition to general trends centered around female children in Uganda.

Questions:

1. What relationships exist within the data for the three different education levels, that is: ple, uce, and uace results?

2. What relationships exist between the external factors: marital and childbearing status and education attained by Ugandans? 3. How does performance vary across genders in Uganda?

Methods, Exploration and Results:

With the above questions in mind, I had to find the appropriate data sets to help me answer my questions. On getting my datasets, I had a huge task of cleaning them up. I had to curate my data, tweaking it to make it appropriate to my analysis arsenal. My first step in my data curation was dealing with missing data. Sometimes this involved calculating the missing values, while others I just simply disregarded columns with a lot of missing data. I then had to add a row specifying the data type in each column. I also ended up combining some data sets: either entirely or just adding columns across various data sets.

Below is the User manual for the A-Lab GUI:

Command q - quit

command r - reset

command o - open new data file

command p - plot data 

command L - linear regression 

command s - save picture 

command a - pca analysis 

command c - cluster analysis

Run the python files to view the project.

In my analysis, I mostly employed linear regression, pca and clustering analysis.
